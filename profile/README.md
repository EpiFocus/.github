# Database Analytics
Using pre-collected data

The analysis of pre-collected medical is an efficient way to undertake bespoke drug & epidemiological research

Care and experience are needed as the data are normally for clinical management and hence understanding data quality is vital

Andrew Maguire developed the main data quality parameter for the THIN database: 

`Maguire A, Blak B, Thompson M. The importance of defining periods of complete mortality reporting for research using automated data from primary care. Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety 2009; 18: 76–83`

# Evidence Strategy
## Planning for your evidence needs
Early evidence to support decision making. Includes disease areas and quantification of unmet medical needs, potential indication(s), rates of likely safety outcomes, how to efficiently measure efficacy and effectiveness. Later needs include studies of drug safety and effectiveness, assessment of accrual of evidence (meta-analysis) and benefit risk assessment
